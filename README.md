# CineNest

CineNest is a personalized streaming platform that allows users to watch movies and series in a lightweight, user-friendly environment. This project was inspired by a desire to create an alternative to platforms like Netflix that operate primarily as a front-end and back-end service provider with high costs. CineNest is designed to be simpler, more cost-effective, and a streamlined solution for entertainment.

## Why CineNest?

I wanted to create a site similar to Netflix but less expensive. Platforms like Netflix operate by sourcing content from other providers and offering a sophisticated front-end and back-end system. CineNest aims to achieve a comparable experience while being accessible and affordable, focusing on streaming simplicity and user satisfaction.
